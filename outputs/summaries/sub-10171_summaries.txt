=== Lay summary ===
Here's a summary of the findings in simple language:

You had a special kind of brain scan called an MRI to help doctors understand your brain better. The scan showed that there is no bleeding in your brain that needs immediate attention.

The scan also looked at specific parts of your brain, such as the frontal and temporal lobes, which are important for thinking, memory, and other important functions. The doctors want to compare the results of the scan with your symptoms and how you're feeling to better understand what's going on with your brain.
