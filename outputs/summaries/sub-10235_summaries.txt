=== Lay summary ===
Here's a summary of the findings in simple language:

You had a special kind of brain scan called an MRI to help doctors understand your brain better. The scan looked at the structure of your brain and how it's working.

The good news is that the scan didn't show any bleeding in your brain that could be causing problems.

The scan also looked at specific parts of your brain that are important for things like thinking, memory, and emotions. These parts are called the frontal lobe and temporal lobe.

The doctors want to compare the results of the scan with how you're feeling and behaving to see if there's a connection between your brain and your symptoms. This will help them better understand what's going on and how to help you.
